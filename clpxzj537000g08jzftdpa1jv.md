In this article we will look at how to manage monorepos using turbo repo.

Monolithic repositories or monorepos are code bases where multiple projects are stored in a single place. Code can be shared between multiple projects and versioned separately.

## Monorepos are not monoliths

Monorepos are not monoliths.

A monorepo is a code base where multiple projects or components are stored in a single repository. It's a way of organising code that allows multiple, potentially unrelated projects to coexist in the same repository.

On the other hand, monolith is a type of software architecture where the entire application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit. All components, modules, and features are part of a single code base and run within a single process.

## Workspace

Workspaces are a way of sharing packages inside a monorepo. A workspace contains multiple smaller packages, each having their own `package.json` file. Each of these packages can be shared across the workspace.

Package managers like npm, yarn and pnpm have support for workspaces. For this article we will use pnpm as our package manager. There procedure is the same for any other package manager.

### Creating a workspace

To create a workspace you need to have a `pnpm-workspace.yml` file at the root. There you can specify the packages you want to include in your workspace.

```yaml
# make docs and everything inside
# packages and apps part of the workspace.
docs
packages/*
apps/*
```

In the above example, we made the `docs` folder and everything inside the `packages` and the `apps` folder part of our workspace.

Each package or app in your workspace must have a name mentioned in its `package.json`. The name is necessary as package managers uses the package name to figure out where to install a package.

Say, we have three packages `foo`, `bar` and `web` (`packages/foo`, `packages/bar` and `apps/web`).

### Installing a package inside a workspace project

Installing a package is same as how you would install normally, except you need to also mention where you want to install the package. For example, if you want to install react, in `app/web`, you need to do run the following command. In our case, the package name is same as the name of the folder.

```bash
# pnpm add react --filter package-name
pnpm add react --filter web
```

### Sharing packages

To use a workspace package inside another package, you need to specify it as a dependency with the `workspace:` suffix in it's version. This tells the package manager to use a local version instead of downloading it from the package registry.

```bash
pnpm i foo@workspace:* --filter web
```

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"shared-package": "workspace:*"
	}
}
```

Here, `*` means the latest version, which saves us from needing to bump the versions of our dependency if the versions of our packages change. You can use a specific version too.

## Turborepo

Turborepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and Typescript code bases. It makes working with monorepos a lot simpler.

## Tasks

Tasks are basically a batch of processes you can run. For example, if you run `turbo run dev`, it will run the `dev` scripts from each of your packages. You can also filter which scripts to run using the `filter` flag. Running `turbo run dev --filter docs,foo` will run the `dev` script inside `docs` and `foo`.

You can configure the behaviour of these tasks. First create a `turbo.json`. Inside this file, you can list all the task and modify their default configuration. For example, turbo caches every build, you can change that by changing the `cache` property.

```json
{ "pipeline": { "dev": { "cache": false } }}
```

If you want intellisense in your `turbo.json` file, add a `$schema` property and set it to `https://turbo.build/schema.json`.

If a task depends on other tasks, we can mention it.

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "lint": { "cache": false },
    "publish": {
	  "dependsOn": ["lint"],
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Caching

Turborepo tries to cache results whenever possible. Basically, it keeps track of the inputs (your code) and outputs (your build outputs and terminal outputs). If the inputs changes, then only it will re-run a task, otherwise, it will just use the cached results.

For every task, you can set `cache` property to true or false. By default, turbo will cache a task. However, for the caching to work properly, we need to specify the build outputs, otherwise it will only cache terminal outputs.

The `outputs` options takes an array of glob paths that are generated as a result of building an application. These `outputs` will not be rebuild if the cache is valid. For example, in a next.js application, you would want to include the `.next` folder, as that is where the build output is generated.

Similar to outputs, you can also mention the inputs. By default, turbo will consider everything (except your outputs) to be your inputs.

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "inputs": ["src/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you use the `no-cache` flag while running a task, turbo will not write to the cache (but it will use the cache if possible).

If you use use the `force` flag, it will not use the cache (but it will write to the cache if possible).

## Remote Caching

Just like local cache, you can download cached results from a remote server and then use it. This is especially helpful for CI pipelines, making them extremely fast. You can learn more about remote caching [here](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching).
