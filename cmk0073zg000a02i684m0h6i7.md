2025 was a great year - built a lot of [cool stuff](https://www.sammaji.com/work), got employed, moved to bengaluru, grew on [X](https://x.com/sammaji15).

here’s some of the things i plan on working in 2026:

* content creation - always been on my “things to do”, but didn’t find much time for it. 2026 will change this.
    
* continuing to working maxim - keep chipping on making maxim the best evals and ai observability platform.
    
* atomo - last year i shared my idea of an [extensible file manager](https://www.sammaji.com/work/atomo) on [r/tauri](https://www.reddit.com/r/tauri/). people loved it, so i am commited to it (though admittedly i couldn’t allocate much time to it last year). here’s some rough timelines:
    
    * finalize plugin spec - march
        
    * beta release - may
